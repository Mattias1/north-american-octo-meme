\section{Problem description}
We present a simulation study for the buffer- and batch-size design of a production line of DVD's.
Moreover, we analyze improvements for the line, by, among others, finding the best buffer- and batch-sizes and alleviating the impact of bottlenecks.

The production process of DVD's consists of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item Injection molding
    \item Dye coating and drying
    \item Sputtering, lacquer coating, drying
    \item Printing and finishing
\end{enumerate}
The machines have limited buffer space, and step C is done with batch processing.
Machines can break down, possibly causing them to be out of production for a while,
and discarding DVD's they were producing. Also some machines need cleaning or replacing of ink.
These problems are solved by repairmen, working in shifts.

Our goal is to optimize the configuration for the batchsize and the buffersizes in terms of performance measures by means of a simulation.
A more detailed description of the simulation that is to be built is found in chapter~\ref{problem_analysis}.

\section{Analysis of the problem}
\label{problem_analysis}
Here follows a more detailed description of the production line that is to be simulated.

\subsection{Machines and buffers}
There are 4 machines of type A, and 2 machines of each of the types B, C and D.
Between every two types of machines there are buffers of a certain size, which can store DVD's until they are fetched by a machine.
There are two buffers between type A and B, each of which can only from a fixed pair of machines of type A, and can provide to a fixed single machine of type B.
There are two buffers between type B and C, each of which consists of a conveyor belt followed by a crate.
These buffers can only receive from a single machine B, but deliver to any of the machines of type C.
The last buffer, between type C and D, can only receive from a fixed machine C, but deliver to any machine of type D.
The current sizes of each buffer is 20 DVD's.
We want to find out if changing this size results in an improvement of the performance measures.

\subsection{Batches}
Every machine only processes a single DVD at a time, except for machine C, which processes a whole batch at a time.
The current size of the batch is 20 DVD's.
We want to find out if changing this size results in an improvement of the performance measures.

% TODO: picture of production line

\subsection{Breakdowns}
As we have already put forward, some machines may breakdown.
This is the case for machines of type A and C.
They break according to a given probability distribution, which is treated in chapter~\ref{input_analysis}.
If such a machine is broken, the DVD's there a currently processed are lost, and the machine has to be repaired.
During day, there are 10 repairmen, and an 11th can be called if necessary.
During night, there are 7 repairmen, and an 8th can be called if necessary.
Each broken machine can be repaired by a single repairman.
Sometimes, a machine of type A needs two repairmen to be repaired.
When a breakdown occurs while no repairmen are available, the machine will be left as broken, until a repairman comes available.

Machines of type B cannot breakdown, but may destroy a DVD by accident.
Machines of type D cannot breakdown either, but sometimes the ink needs to be replaced.
This costs a repairman as well.
However, the DVD's that are currently processed are not lost.


\section{Assumptions}
Here we list the most relevant assumptions for our simulation.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Machine A discards any DVD's that is being produced at the event of a breakdown.
    \item
        Machine A has unlimited raw material input.
    \item
        When machine A breaks, sometimes there are two repairmen needed to repair it.
        We assume that this happens half of the time.
        This way we are not likely to assume too little.
    \item
        Machines C and D are expected to start with cleaning or ink replacing after the (batch of) DVD's is finished.
    \item
        We assume that a repairman finishes repairing the machine before going home.
    \item
        We start the simulation at 6 o'clock in the morning.
    \item
        We assume that calling an extra repairman costs negligible time.
\end{enumerate}


\section{The model}
\subsection{State}
The factory has a set of state variables, and each of the machines also has some state variables of his own.
The state of the factory consists of the current time, whether it is day or night and the amount of repairman available.
Of course, the state also contains a list of machines, each of these machines have the following state variables:
The status of the machine, this is used to see if the machine is busy producing DVD's, if it is currently not doing anything, or if it's broken or being repaired (possibly with two repairmen).
It also maintains whether or not it has discarded it's latest DVD\@.
Each machine also maintains the amount of DVD's in the buffer after him (so machine B maintains the count of the buffer between machine B and machine C).

\subsection{Performance measures}
\label{performance_measures}
We measure the total production of DVD's, the average production per DVD,
and the average throughput.
Apart from that, we measure some more statistics per machine, to look for bottlenecks:
The number of breakdowns, the total amount of DVD's a machine has produced,
the total amount of discarded DVD's and the time the machine is down, busy producing, or idle.

\subsection{The event handlers}
% Updating state - measure performance, schedule new events.
\begin{enumerate}
    % The machine start and finish events
    \item Machine start:
        This is the event where the machine starts producing his DVD (or batch of DVD's).
        It removes a DVD from the previous buffer
        (except for machine A of course, it creates a new DVD),
        it updates it's status to busy, and then schedules the machine end event.
        Removing an item from the previous buffer can possibly schedule a machine start event, if it was doing nothing because the buffer was full.
    \item Machine finish:
        This is the event where the machine finishes producing his DVD (or batch of DVD's).
        It sets it's status to idle and adds a product to one of it's receiver buffers (when they are not full etc.).
        Furthermore it updates the total amount of produced DVD's and it schedules a machine start event.
        Adding an item to the buffer can possibly schedule a machine start event if it was idle due to a full buffer.
        For machine B the finish producing can also discard a DVD,
        for machine C and D it can schedule a start repair event.

    % Buffer events
    \item Put in crate:
        This event is fired when a DVD leaves the conveyor belt, and is put in a crate, that is the buffer between machine B and C.
        It adds the DVD to the buffer of course, and schedules the next put in crate event.
        The conveyor belt is modelled as a queue of times between each DVD on the conveyor belt. That way we can effectively get the time of the first DVD that leaves the conveyor belt.
        This event can also possibly schedule a start producing event in case of idle machines due to a full buffer.

    % The breakdown events
    \item Start repairing:
        This is the event that is fired in case of a breakdown, machine cleaning, or ink replacing. The effect in real life is that a machine cannot be used for a while, and is called start repairing for convenience.
        It updates the status of the machine to repairing
        (or repairing double if two repairmen are nescessary).
        If there are no repairmen available it sets the status to broken.
        It also updates the amount of breakdowns, the amount of discarded DVD's (if nescessary) and the amount of available repairmen.
        It schedules the end repair event.
        Note that machine B does not have repair events.

    \item Finish repairing:
        The end repair event is fired when a repairman is done with it's task.
        It sets the machine's status to idle, adds a repairman (or two) to the available repairmen list.
        It schedules a start producing event and for machine A also the new start repair event.

    % EOS
    \item End of simulation:
        This event ends the simulation, it fires either after a specified duration, or when the user stops the simulation manually.
        
\end{enumerate}


\section{Input analysis}
\label{input_analysis}
Some parameters are exact, others comprise a certain degree of randomness.
For the latter ones, we present here how the data collection (i.e.\ generation) is implemented in the simulation.

Some input spaces are given in the form of a theoretical probability distribution.
Others are given in the form of an empirical probability distribution.
For dealing with empirical distributions, we pick a random number from the sorted empirical data, then pick a number between this number and the next number with uniform probability, i.e.\ we interpolate the empirical distribution linearly.
This way we do not have to care about catching the empirical data in a theoretical probability distribution.
In table~\ref{table:input_table} we have listed the kinds of input data we have for the several machine parameters.

\section{Experiments}
% TODO:
% - arguments for running time of choice (steady state etc)
% - input analysis
%
\subsection{Set up}
Our goal is to give insight in possible improvements in the production process of the DVD production line with respect to changes in the buffersizes and the batchsize of the machines.
To do so, we will mainly investigate the performance measures mentioned in section~\ref{performance_measures}, and see wether they can coexist optimally or there is a trade-off involved.
While having the simulation at hand anyway, we can also have a look for possible bottlenecks caused by things other than the configuration of the buffersizes and the batchsize.

We will choose various configurations for the buffersizes and the batchsize, and run the simulation several times for each of the configurations.

For each configuration:
    run simulation and compute performance measures and confidence interval
    conclude which configurations provide significant improvements


As confidence level $1 - \alpha$ we choose the fairly standard value of $0.95$.
Suppose that we run the simulation, for each configuration, $n$ times, resulting in $n$ sample values, for each performance measure, with mean $\bar{x}$ and deviation $s$.

Then $P(-c \leq T \leq c) = 0.95 $ with $T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ (student t distribution) and $c = \Phi ^{-1} (1 - \frac{\alpha}{2})= 1.96$.
From this it follows that the confidence interval can be computed as
\[ (\bar{x} - \frac{cs}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{x} + \frac{cs}{\sqrt{n}}) =
(\bar{x} - \frac{1.96s}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{x} + \frac{1.96s}{\sqrt{n}}). \]
